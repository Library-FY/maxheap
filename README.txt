A set of functions to implement a max-heap priority queue in Python.  I wrote this to study for a computer science class exam and figured that it may come in handy some day, so I might as well clean it up and publish it online.

Functions:
----------
heapify     - convert a list/array into a binary max-heap.
push_heap   - pushes a value onto the heap, maintaining the heap property. 
pop_heap    - pops the max value from the heap, maintaining the heap property.
replace_key - replace a value on the heap with a different one.

See the docstrings of the individual functions for more information on them.
